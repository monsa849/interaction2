      <aside><p class="body-text">My name is Annabel Monsky, and I am 25 years old. I was born and raised in Manhattan, New York. I currently attend The Parsons School of Design. I am originally from the Upper East Side but now live in the Union Square area to be near school. I am earning a degree in Integrated Design (BFA) because the major enables me to explore many interests. In my free time, I play guitar and sing. Sometimes I write poems, so pursuing side gigs in singing and songwriting might be cool after graduating.</p></aside>
