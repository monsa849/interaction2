      <aside><p class="body-text">My name is Annabel Monsky, and I am 25 years old. I was born and raised in Manhattan, New York. I went to Bucknell University in rural Pennsylvania before transferring to Parsons School of Design in Manhattan. I am originally from the Upper East Side, but now I live in the Union Square area to be close to school. I am earning a degree in Integrated Design (BFA) because the major enables me to explore many interests. In my free time, I play guitar and sing. Sometimes I write poems and so think it might be cool to pursue side gigs in singing and songwriting after graduating.</p></aside>
