<p> Always doing this to me<br>With every new stage of life<br>Another part of my heart dies<br>When another stupid guy<br>Decides<br>He wants<br>To show me<br>How it's done</p>

 <button class="writing">If you just sit there<br>I could run my fingers through your hair<br>And maybe help you<br>Forget about her.<br>He let me run my fingers through his hair<br>Intimately<br>But couldn't help remembering his fear</button>

<button class="goodbye">I just thought<br>Play a game of manipulation dare to give into temptation what could be in our universe is filled with endless possibility.<br>
Overwhelmed in flight I fight with my
Might<br>So just take down your towers and let me 
See light<br>
Unmasked, unblanketed.
Arisen from ashes.
Crashes. I am risky, a mystery
I’m misting.<br>
So fast you might miss me.<br>
Too hot you might kiss me on a skating
Rink made of ice.<br>
Have you fallen for me yet? Don't think a first date's been set.<br>
This is how I sail with tact. Bend and snap. 
Breathe it in. Let it go. I’m over all that.	
Next level. Way round we go.
The long and winding road that
Leads me home. Maybe to you.
</button>

<p> Always doing this to me<br>With every new stage of life<br>A new part of my heart dies<br>When another stupid guy<br>Decides<br>He wants<br>To show me<br>How it's done</p>

<button class="writing">Lover is a tall blonde man.<br>So pale don’t think he’s ever been tan.<br>He has passion and gusto and like me he cares.<br>Maybe more.</button>

<button class="goodbye">I like running my hands through his hair and kissing his shoulder blades.
<br>He might still be in love with his ex.<br>A Don Juan so sweet<br>My yummy treat.
<br>Tired of trying to write words<br>Expressing how I feel<br>Bout having you<br>In my world</button>

<p> Always doing this to me<br>At new every stage of life<br>A new part of my heart dies<br>When another stupid guy<br>Decides<br>He wants<br>To show me<br>How it's done</p>
