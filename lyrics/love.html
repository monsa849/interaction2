<p> Intoxicated with the way you move<br> the way you move<br>the way you move<br>the way you move<br>the way you<br>I just forgot how to move<br>teach me<br>What does moving mean anyway</p>

 <button class="sunset">You said I don't care said live your life.<br>And I just thought ok, it will be alright.</button>

<button class="sunset">In this place I can't escape <br>the mess you made<br>With your love<br></button>

<button class="praying">or lack thereof</button>

<button class="goodbye">And you know even though<br>When we're together<br>I melt<br>You melt<br>And we melt together<br>Over and over and over<br>Until we're so drunk with lust<br>Forget we can't trust<br>Anything about each other<br></button>

I still feel you<br>hear you<br>and breathe you<br>when<br>I sing<br></button>

<button class="writing">Still in love with the lust<br>The thurst of it all <br>The way you let me be me right here<br></button>

<button class="praying">Dancing to no music<br>We keep it silent.<br>Know how you like it<br>Just like ice<br>You hurt me so nice<br>Said you're dead inside<br>But left me feeling more alive<br>Than ever<br>A blessing in disguise<br>Not to call you mine</button>

<button class="writing">But if you came back<br> Home to me tonight<br>I'm sure I'd make it<br>Worth our time<br></button>
