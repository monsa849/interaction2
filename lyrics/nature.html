<div id="the-tree">
<h1>Roots are long,</h1>
<h2>They dig in deep.</h2> 
			<p>
My body like bark,
My hips so rough,<br>
I’m dancing to the wind, <br>
In lifetime.
</p>
</div>

<div id="the-tree">
To each her own. <br>
Together, alone.<br>
Breathing, beating, changing growth.<br>
The giving tree. <br>
Is that me? <br>
Shel Silverstein—<br>
hear him pump blood in me!<br>
My spine gets cold, my arms grow old.
I was planted shallow and now reach out<br>
to spurt.<br>
</p>
<p>
<br>Oceanic fish in the sea,<br>
<br>Kangaroos go orange<br>
against Arizona's midnight sky.<br>
Twinkle twinkle little lights<br>
Oh-<br>
How I love to dance
<br>with fireflies.
</p>
	<p>
on a winter’s day<br>
we watch your breath<br>
fade to gray<br> 
I see children dance and play.<br>
</p>
	<p>
My crown is electric. Blue.<br>
Blue. <br>
Gold, brown, orange, and blue.<br>
Hear me make love to you. <br>
Touch my soul.<br>
the ring around my poem.<br>
It is so blue. And you<br>
you are too.<br>
</p>
	<p>
Purple and pink melt into <br>
the sunset's ink<br>
a palette on painter's trays.<br>
In case I don't get to see you again<br>
I will say<br>
Adieu.<br>
<br>
