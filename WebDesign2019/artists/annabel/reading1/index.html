        <h1>Reading Response 1: Laurel Schwulst</h1>
<p><br>Does having more tools and options regarding how to build a website helpful or does it make the job more difficult?<br>
<br>And, how do we measure whether having more options is helping us progress or making web design more complicated and challenging?<br></p>

<h2>Reading Response 2: "What is Code?"</h2>
<p>As technology advances, users seem to become better at learning how it works.
<br>In the future, will most users be able to code on their own without help from professional programmers, merely as a result of adapting to how technology evolves?</p>
<p>I like the quote, "You can make computers do wonderful things, but you need to understand their limits."
<br>I think in general, technology has made people much lazier and more impatient. I wonder if this trend will continue and get worse in the future.</p>
