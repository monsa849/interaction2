<header>Response 1: Laurel Schwulst</header>
<br>1) Does having more tools and options regarding how to build a website helpful or does it make the job more difficult?<br>
<br>2) How do we measure whether having more options is helping us progress or making web design more complicated and challenging?<br>

<br><header>Response 2: "What is Code?"</header>
<br>1) As technology advances, users seem to become better at learning how it works.<br>
<br>In the future, will most users be able to code on their own without help from professional programmers, merely as a result of adapting to how technology evolves?<br>
<br>2) I like the quote, "You can make computers do wonderful things, but you need to understand their limits."<br>
<br>I think in general, technology has made people much lazier and more impatient. I wonder if this trend will continue and get worse in the future.

<br><header>Reading Response 3: "Websites are the Art of Our Times"</header>
<br>1) I like the quote, “Most Web Entities are social entities. They get in touch and advertise their existence to each other. Similar to human beings, they will evaluate, criticize, ‘link’ to each other, and ultimately, they develop a ‘taste.’”
How are programmers similar to digital “influencers"? The quote leads me to ponder if digital “influencers” also knack coding, because both kinds of work involve some similar ways of thinking?<br>
<br>“Influencers” often link their personal products to outside sources and make changes after reviewing data analytics while successful programmers focus on linking processes too.<br>
<br>2) I think traditional education fails many students by influencing them to think subjects relating to the computer like programming are entirely separate from "art".<br>
<br> Truthfully, "art" is what we make of it. Sometimes the most successful artists are those who know hwo to illustrate their ideas by using unconventional mediums like on the web, as well as more predictable ones.<br>
                   
                   <div class="responseFour">
<br><header>Response 4: Material Design</header>
<br>1) When is it better to design icons and typeface by hand versus using computer programs? I think there are pros and cons to both.<br>
<br> 2) How can I maximize the amount of time I spend designing by sketching by hand and minimizing the amount of energy I expend towards coding on the web? I am asking because I have migraines, so the less time I can spend staring at the computer screen, the better!<br>
